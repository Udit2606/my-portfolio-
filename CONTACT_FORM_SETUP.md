   - **Subject**: The subject they entered (or "Contact from Portfolio")
   - **Body**: Formatted message with their details
5. **User sends the email** from their email client

### **Features Added:**

## 🔧 Customization

### **To change the email address:**

const mailtoLink = `mailto:YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com?subject=${subject}&body=${body}`
```

### **To modify the email template:**
Update lines 691-693 in `app/page.tsx`:
```typescript
const body = encodeURIComponent(
  `Your custom template here:\nName: ${formData.name}\nEmail: ${formData.email}\n\nMessage:\n${formData.message}`
)
```

## 📊 Form Analytics (Optional)

### **Track form submissions:**
- Add Google Analytics events
- Monitor conversion rates
- Track user engagement

### **Example implementation:**
```typescript
// Add to handleSubmit function
gtag('event', 'form_submit', {
  event_category: 'contact',
  event_label: 'portfolio_contact_form'
})
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### **Current implementation is secure because:**
- ✅ **No server-side processing** - No backend vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Client-side only** - Uses user's email client
- ✅ **No data storage** - Information not stored anywhere
- ✅ **User control** - User decides when to send

### **For advanced implementations:**
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement rate limiting
- Add CAPTCHA for spam protection
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
